# Brandlive Code Challenge

## Introduction

This code challenge was for employment at Brandlive as a Web Develoepr. I was to recreate a landing page based off of a mockup.

## How to run the code

The easiest way to run the code is to click on the green "Code" button at the top and click on "Download ZIP" to download the ZIP file to your Desktop.

Once the file is downloaded, you will need to extract the contacts of the ZIP file using your favorite (or built-in) program for your computer. You should be able to just double-click the ZIP file on your Desktop to unzip the file.

You will then open the unzipped folder on your Desktop (or wherever you placed the unzipped file) and click on the "index.html" file in the folder. This will open up the project.

## View Live Online

You are also able to view the completed landing page live at [https://jonbascos.github.io/code-challenge-brandlive](https://jonbascos.github.io/code-challenge-brandlive)
